This project involves developing a simple real-time object detection application in Android 
Studio. The project utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to enable the 
detection and classification of objects in real-time using the device's camera feed. The Android 
application integrates camera functionality to stream live video frames, and a pre-trained object 
detection model, such as Mobile Net or Tiny YOLO, is utilized to identify objects within the 
frames. The detected objects are then visually presented to the user through bounding boxes and 
labels overlaid on the camera preview. The project also focuses on optimizing the performance 
of the object detection system through techniques such as model quantization and multithreading.
The final application is deployed as an APK file, enabling users to perform real-time 
object detection on their Android devices. This project serves as a practical demonstration of 
implementing a simple yet effective object detection system within the Android environment.
